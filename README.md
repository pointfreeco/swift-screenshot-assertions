Delightful Swift snapshot testing.

## Usage

Once the library [is installed](#installation), _no additional configuration is required_. You can import the `SnapshotTesting` module into a test and pass a value to the `assertSnapshot` function.

``` swift
import SnapshotTesting
import XCTest

class MyViewControllerTests: XCTestCase {
  func testMyViewController() {
    let vc = MyViewController()

    assertSnapshot(matching: vc, as: .image)
  }
}
```

When the test first runs, a snapshot is recorded automatically to disk and the test will fail and print out the file path of the reference.

> ðŸ›‘ failed - Recorded: â€¦
>
> "â€¦/MyAppTests/\_\_Snapshots\_\_/MyViewControllerTests/testMyViewController.png"

Repeat test runs will load this reference for comparison. If the images don't match, the test will fail and print out the file path of each image for further inspection.

You can record a new reference by setting `record` mode to `true` on the assertion or globally.

``` swift
assertSnapshot(matching: vc, as: .image, record: true)

// or globally

record = true
assertSnapshot(matching: vc, as: .image)
```

## Defining Your Own Strategies

## Installation

### Carthage

If you use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), you can add the following dependency to your `Cartfile`:

``` ruby
github "pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing" "master"
```

### CocoaPods

If your project uses [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), add the pod to any applicable test targets in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
target 'MyAppTests' do
  pod 'SnapshotTesting', :git => 'https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing.git'
end
```

### Swift Package Manager

If you want to use SnapshotTesting in a project that uses [SwiftPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the package as a dependency in `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing.git", .branch("master")),
]
```

## Features

- **Snapshot test _anything_.** Snapshot testing isnâ€™t just for UI. Write snapshots against _any_ format.
- **No configuration required.** Donâ€™t fuss with scheme settings and environment variables. Snapshots are automatically saved alongside your tests.
- **More hands-off.** New snapshots are automatically recorded.
- **Subclass-free.** Assert from any XCTest test case or Quick spec.
- **Device-agnostic snapshots.** Render views and view controllers for specific devices and trait collections from a single simulator.
- **First-class Xcode support.** Image differences are captured as XCTest attachments. Text differences are rendered in inline error messages.
- **iOS, macOS, and tvOS support.**
- **SceneKit, SpriteKit, and WebKit support.**
- **Test _any_ data structure.** Snap complex app state in a dependable way.
- **Codable support**. Snapshot your data structures into JSON and property lists.

## Usage

Snapshot Testing provides an `assertSnapshot` function for asserting that the reference data on disk matches the current snapshot of your data. The reference data can be plain text, an image, or any other data format you may be interested in.

### Basics

Suppose you had an `ApiService` that creates properly formatted URL requests to your web API. It might be responsible for attaching authorization to the query params, setting some custom request headers, and more. You can write an assertion against the `URLRequest` that is constructed from your service to give broad test coverage across all the properties of the value:

```swift
import SnapshotTesting
import XCTest

class ApiServiceTests: XCTestCase {
  func testUrlRequestPreparation() {
    let service = ApiService()
    let request = service
      .prepare(endpoint: .createArticle("Hello, world!"))

    assertSnapshot(matching: request, as: .raw)
  }
}
```

The first time this is run, a file will be written to `__Snapshots__/ApiServiceTests/testUrlRequestPreparation.0.txt`:

```txt
POST https://api.site.com/articles?oauth_token=deadbeef
User-Agent: iOS/BlobApp 1.0
X-App-Version: 42

title=Hello%20World
```

Subsequent test runs will generate a new snapshot and assert it against the contents of this file on disk. If there are any differences, the test will fail and present a nicely formatted diff. For example, suppose that during a refactor we accidentally broke the logic that sets the HTTP method of the request. This would easily be caught in our snapshot:

```diff
-POST https://api.site.com/articles?oauth_token=deadbeef
+GET https://api.site.com/articles?oauth_token=deadbeef
 User-Agent: iOS/BlobApp 1.0
 X-App-Version: 42
 
 title=Hello%20World
```

### Snapshot strategies

The `assertSnapshot` helper allows you to customize how you want to snapshot your values by providing a `Strategy`. It is a concrete datatype that describes preicsely how to snapshot a value, including how to serialize/deserialize to/from disk, and how to display a human friendly description of a diff. Snapshot Testing comes with many strategies for snapshotting a wide assortment of Foundation, UIKit and Cocoa types in both text and image formats.

For example, a `UIView` could be snapshot as an image:

```swift
let myView = ...
assertSnapshot(myView, as: .image)
```

But it could also be snapshot as a textual description of the view tree hierarchy:

```swift
let myView = ...
assertSnapshot(myView, as: .recursiveDescription)
```

Note that we can use the abbreviated `.image` and `.recursiveDescription` syntax because `image` is a static property on `Strategy`.



### Custom snapshot strategies

Although the library comes with [many](link) snapshot strategies for various types in Foundation, UIKit and Cocoa, there are still going to be times you want to customize a snapshot's output. For those times, you want to create a custom `Strategy` value that can be passed to the `assertSnapshot` helper.

### Advanced

Some types need additional set up time in order to be snapshot. For example, `WKWebView` needs to wait for a delegate callback that says the view is finished loading before it can be snapshot. For this reason, `Strategy` does not use a function of the form `(Snapshottable) -> Format` to snapshot types, but rather a function `(Snapshottable) -> Async<Format>`, where `Async` is a wrapper around a callback. This allows you to take as much time as you need to perform the snapshot.

For example, to snapshot a `WKWebView` you must wait until the delegate calls `webView(_:didFinish:)`. This can handily be done using `Async`:

```swift
private final class NavigationDelegate: NSObject, WKNavigationDelegate {
  var didFinish: () -> Void = { }

  func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didFinish navigation: WKNavigation!) {
    self.didFinish()
  }
}

let webViewImage = Strategy<WKWebView, UIImage>(
  pathExtension: "png",
  diffable: .image,
  snapshotToDiffable: { webView in
    Async<UIImage> { callback in 
      let delegate = NavigationDelegate()
      delegate.didFinish = {
        webView.takeSnapshot(with: nil) { image, _ in 
          callback(image!)
        }
      }
      webView.navigationDelegate = delegate
    }
  }
)
```

## Usage

Snapshot Testing provides an `assertSnapshot` function, which records data structures as text or images accordingly.

Here's how you might test a URL request you've prepared for your app's API client:

```swift
import SnapshotTesting
import XCTest

class ApiServiceTests: XCTestCase {
  func testUrlRequestPreparation() {
    let service = ApiService()
    let request = service
      .prepare(endpoint: .createArticle("Hello, world!"))

    assertSnapshot(matching: request)
  }
}
```

The above will render as the following text to `__Snapshots__/ApiServiceTests/testUrlRequestPreparation.0.txt`:

```
â–¿ https://api.site.com/articles?oauth_token=deadbeef
  â–¿ url: Optional(https://api.site.com/articles?oauth_token=deadbeef)
    â–¿ some: https://api.site.com/articles?oauth_token=deadbeef
      - _url: https://api.site.com/articles?oauth_token=deadbeef #0
        - super: NSObject
  - cachePolicy: 0
  - timeoutInterval: 60.0
  - mainDocumentURL: nil
  - networkServiceType: __ObjC.NSURLRequest.NetworkServiceType
  - allowsCellularAccess: true
  â–¿ httpMethod: Optional("POST")
    - some: "POST"
  â–¿ allHTTPHeaderFields: Optional(["App-Version": "42"])
    â–¿ some: 1 key/value pairs
      â–¿ (2 elements)
        - key: "App-Version"
        - value: "42"
  â–¿ httpBody: Optional(19 bytes)
    â–¿ some: "body=Hello%20world!"
  - httpBodyStream: nil
  - httpShouldHandleCookies: true
  - httpShouldUsePipelining: false
```

Renderable data will write as an image. This includes `UIImage`s and `NSImage`s, but also data that is typically viewed visually, like `UIView`s and `NSView`s.

Given a view:

``` swift
import SnapshotTesting
import XCTest

class HomepageTests: XCTestCase {
  func testRender() {
    let size = CGSize(width: 800, height: 600)
    let webView = UIWebView(frame: .init(origin: .zero, size: size))
    webView.loadHTMLString(renderHomepage())

    assertSnapshot(matching: webView)
  }
}
```

The above will write to an image on disk. If that image ever renders differently in the future, the assertion will fail and produce a diff for inspection.
